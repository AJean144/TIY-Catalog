# Etsy Product Catalog via Angular JS

Using the [Esty API](http://etsy.com/developers) and [these credentials](#api-credentials), we're going to build a reasonable facsimile of [Etsy.com](http://etsy.com) that's responsive and showcases the [Trending Items](https://www.etsy.com/trending) and [listing pages](https://www.etsy.com/search/toys-and-games) for [select categories](https://www.etsy.com/categories). Then we'll take a crack at trying to _buy_ stuff!

To help us with User Interface interactions, we'll build out a few Codrops:

* `menu.html`: [Horizontal Slide-Out Menu](http://tympanus.net/Blueprints/HorizontalSlideOutMenu/)
* `products.html`: [View Mode Switch](http://tympanus.net/Blueprints/ViewModeSwitch/)
* `product.html`: [Responsive Product Grid](http://tympanus.net/Blueprints/ProductGridLayout/)

And to keep us on track, we should write out some _User Stories_:

## User Stories

### A Smurf can smurf so that Smurfs can smurf (XX)

* smurfing is hard
* always remember to smurf!
* don't forget to smurf the smurfs after smurfing
